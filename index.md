## Welcome

Hello! I am a senior undergraduate student at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, pursuing dual degrees in **Energy and Power Engineering** and **Mathematics**. I am currently a Research Assistant at the **University of Notre Dame** through the iSURE Program, advised by [Prof. Jian-xun Wang](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/jian-xun-wang/).

My research lies at the intersection of **Scientific Machine Learning** and **Computational Fluid Dynamics**, with a particular focus on applying data-driven techniques to cardiovascular hemodynamic modeling and optimization.

I am also collaborating with [Prof. Chonghuan Wang](https://chonghuanwang.github.io/) at UT Dallas on understanding the decision-making mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs).

I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities to begin in Fall 2026. If you have any openings that align with my background, I would be grateful to discuss them.
