## Welcome

Hello! I am a senior undergraduate student at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, pursuing dual degrees in Energy and Power Engineering and Mathematics. I am very fortunate to be a Research Assistant at the University of Notre Dame, advised by [Prof. Jian-xun Wang](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/jian-xun-wang/). 

My current research topic focuses on applying machine learning to cardiovascular fluid dynamics.

I am passionate about **Scientific Machine Learning** and leveraging data-driven and statistical techniques to model and understand complex physical systems. I'm always open to discussing new research ideas and potential collaborations, so please feel free to get in touch.

I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities to begin in Fall 2026. If you have any openings that align with my background, I would be grateful to discuss them. Please feel free to contact me.
